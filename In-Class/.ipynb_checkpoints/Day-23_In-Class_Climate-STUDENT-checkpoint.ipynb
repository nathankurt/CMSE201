    "**In today's class**, we are going to examine several datasets that show how various quantities (such as global temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels) have evolved over time.  The datasets that we will use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A reconstruction of the global surface temperature, deep-sea temperature, ice volume, and relative sea level for the last **3 million years**.  This data, in the file ```bintanja2008.txt```, comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Center website, and can be [found here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/11933).  Note that the temperature measurements in this file are estimated using a proxy measurement using the chemical composition of core samples from ocean sediments.\n",
    "2. Measurements of global mean air temperatures from 1880 through the present day. Specifically, these are recorded as **deviations from the mean temperature** at a particular time. This data, in the file ```GLB.Ts.csv```, comes from the [NASA GISS surface temperature website](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), \"Global-mean monthly, seasonal, and annual means, 1880-present.\"  See [this file](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts.txt) for clues as to what the columns mean.  Note that these temperatures are measured directly (i.e., with thermometers), rather than estimated using a proxy!\n",
    "3. Measurements of average monthly atmospheric [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (CO2) concentration from 1958 through the present, measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.  This data, in the file ```co2_mm_mlo.txt,``` comes from the [Earth Systems Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/) global monitoring division, and can be [found here](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt).  Note that the \"concentration\" data is reported in units of \"micromol/mol\", meaning parts per million in the atmosphere.  This data is measured directly.\n",
    "4. Measurements of average average yearly [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane) (CH4) concentrations from 1984 through the present, measured at a variety of locations around the world.  This data, in the file ```ch4_annmean_gl.txt```, also comes from the [Earth Systems Research Laboratory](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_ch4/), and can be [found here](ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/products/trends/ch4/ch4_annmean_gl.txt).  In this file, the \"concentration level\" is listed in parts per billion (rather than parts per million, as was done with CO2).  This data is measured directly.\n",
    "5. Reconstructions of the global atmospheric temperature, as well as atmospheric CO2 and CH4 levels, from [ice core samples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core) taken at the [Vostok Research Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok_Station) in Antarctica.  Again, the temperature values are recorded as deviations from the mean temperature at a particular time. This data is in the files ```vostok-deutnat.txt``` (temperature), ```vostok-co2nat.txt``` (CO2), and ```vostok-ch4nat.txt``` (CH4).  This data was obtained from the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) and can be found [at this web page](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/).  The temperature is estimated; CO2 and CH4 concentrations are measured directly from the ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up each of the datasets and look at the headers - that is, the block of text at the top that describes what's in the file.  You will have to do this to understand which columns you want to use, what the units are, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Numpy, read each of these datasets into numpy arrays!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into confusing issues if you try to use Pandas to read in these datasets. Given this, you are expected to use `np.loadtxt()` to read them in. You will have to take into account the fact that each of the files has a header of a different length - you can either figure the length out yourself, or **look at the README provided at the bottom of this notebook**.  Then, **modify the times and temperatures for each dataset so that they have consistent units** (since some datasets are in \"years before present\", whereas others use the Gregorian dating system, and some of the datasets use temperature differences in Kelvin whereas others use hundredths of a Kelvin. If you're not familiar with Kelvin as a temperature unit, look [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin))."
