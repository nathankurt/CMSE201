    "\n",
    "1. the simplest possible model to show how the carbon reservoirs and fluxes change with time, which tracks just the major carbon reservoirs and *natural* fluxes\n",
    "2. one that includes [anthropogenic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropogenic) (i.e., human-caused) fluxes of carbon (which should be an extension of the first model), with a function that controls the flux of human-generated carbon over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how you will initialize the simulation, how you will evolve it in time, and how you will stop it.  Also, make sure to think about how you will keep track of the amount of carbon in each reservoir!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is meant to be a set of simple update equations, and should *not* be solved using odeint (you don't have quite enough information to create a model that is solvable in that manner).  As an example, if you had two carbon reservoirs, R$_A$ and R$_B$, and a flux F$_{A \\rightarrow B}$ showing the amount of carbon per year that goes from reservoir A to reservoir B, the update equations would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{A}^{N+1} = R_{A}^{N} - F_{A \\rightarrow B} \\Delta t $$\n",

(That's what should happen!)  If you set the human-generated carbon flux at 9 gigatons of carbon per year entering the atmosphere, does the amount of carbon increase in a way that is consistent with your modeling from the last class?
