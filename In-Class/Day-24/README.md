# Datasets

## Datasets from the modern era

GLB.Ts.csv -- Measurements of global mean air temperatures from 1880
through the present day.  Note that temperatures are in hundredths of
a degree Kelvin. The header is 1 line long.

co2_mm_mlo.txt -- Measurements of average monthly atmospheric carbon
dioxide (CO2) concentration from 1958 through the present.  The header
is 72 lines long.

ch4_annmean_gl.txt -- Measurements of average average yearly methane
(CH4) concentrations from 1984 through the present.  The header is 56
lines long.

## Marine sediment dataset

bintanja2008.txt -- A reconstruction of the global surface
temperature, deep-sea temperature, ice volume, and relative sea level
for the last 3 million years.  The header is 109 lines long.

## Vostok datasets

vostok-deutnat.txt -- Reconstructions of the global atmospheric
temperature using ice core data.  Note that column 2 is ice age (i.e.,
number of years in the past) and column 4 is the temperature
difference from the present day in degrees Kelvin.  The header is 111
lines long.

vostok-co2nat.txt -- Reconstructions of the global carbon dioxide
(CO2) concentration using ice core data.  The header is 155 lines
long.

vostok-ch4nat.txt -- Reconstructions of the global methane (CH4)
concentration using ice core data.  The header is 86 lines long.
