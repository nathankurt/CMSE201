    "In this assignment, we are going to introduce you to some higher dimensional arrays. In using the term \"dimension\" when talking about arrays, it can _almost_ help to think about these like geometrical shapes or objects. A line only has a length to it, so we call it a one dimensional object. A square, however, has a length _and_ a width, so we call it a two dimensional object. Though this metaphor can start to break down as the shapes become more complex, it works for our 1D and 2D cases. A 1D array is simply a single array of value, like `array([1,2,3,4,5])`. A 2D array, which we are going to introduce here today, is as bit more complex. 2D arrays are very commonly used in computational modeling and data analysis for reasons that will hopefully be clear after today."

That would take a long time. But, we can use 2D indexing to speed things up a bit and change ranges of elements at a time. For example, the ship on the right-hand side of the board which occupies three squares could be placed on our board using the following line of code: `board[3:6,8] = 1`, which indexes the rows 3, 4, and 5 (not 6 because the endpoint is not included!) of the board and column 8 of the board, then sets the values at those locations to be 1.\n",
