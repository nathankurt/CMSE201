    "In short, a flipped classroom has students spending time outside of class working through instructional materials developed by the professor known as pre-class assignments. In the context of this course, this will entail things such as watching video lectures made by the instructional staff or found online, reading articles, and working through structured coding activities. One benefit to doing this is it allows students to learn from these materials at their own pace. During a lecture, students must work at the pace of whoever is giving the lecture. But here, one can rewind videos as needed, reread passages, or move past material they feel they have already mastered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the work being done at home is so that the time in class can be spent working on what would have traditionally been labeled as “homework assignments” with other students in this class. We will be referring to these as \"in-class assignments.\" During these in-class assignments, the instructional staff are there to provide focused support where needed and help to alleviate any confusion surrounding the material. This model of instruction allows for students to get more one-on-one attention from teachers as well as additional support that comes from working with other people. \n",

In fact, research has shown that there are many benefits to learning in a flipped classroom and many times students learn **more** than they would in a more traditional classroom.\n",
