    "## Understanding the Earth's climate\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next three days of class, you will be using a combination of data analysis and modeling to understand the Earth's climate, the relationship between greenhouse gases and temperature in the Earth's atmosphere, and the global carbon cycle and how it relates to climate and global temperature.  We'll use many of the techniques that you have learned this semester to do so!\n",

    "Global climate change is a huge and complex issue, with important consequences for [global peace and human development](https://blog.oup.com/2017/06/climate-change-global-peace-security/), particularly in countries that are not particularly wealthy or technologically advanced (and thus will have greater challenges dealing with a changing world).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In preparation for the in-class assignment,** you need to read and think about how global temperatures are measured, and examine historical climate and sea level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read the Wikipedia articles on [the global temperature record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record), [paleoclimatology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoclimatology) (that is, the study of climate changes over the entire history of the Earth), and [this NASA article on estimating historical temperatures](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_01/).  In the box below, describe how we estimate the Earth's  atmospheric temperature in the last few hundred, tens of thousands, and millions of years.  How confident are scientists in these predictions?

    "The file ```bintanja2008.txt``` is included with this assignment, and is from the journal article \"North American ice-sheet dynamics and the onset of 100,000-year glacial cycles,\" by Bintanja and van de Wald ([2008, Nature, **454**, 869-872](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature07158)).  The dataset that comes from [this archive](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/11933) at the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/), and is a reconstruction of the global surface temperature, deep-sea temperature, ice volume, and relative sea level for the last **3 million years**.  Note that this file has been very slightly modified to remove some characters that Numpy and Pandas have problems with (letters with accents), but actual data has not been changed!\n",

Note that column 9, \"Global sea level relative to present,\" is in confusing units - more positive values actually correspond to *lower* sea levels than less positive values. Also \"BP\" means \"Before Present.\" \n",

It's fine to load all of the data into a single combined multi-dimensional array if you want, or split the data into multiple arrays.  **HINTS:**  The header is 109 rows long, and the file is set up so that each column is a separate dataset (so you may wish to remind yourself of how the ```unpack``` argument for ```loadtxt``` works)"
