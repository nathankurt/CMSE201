    "## More details about agent-based models\n",
    "(**Note**: We've intentionally put a fair bit of text here so that you have a place to refer back to about these models. If you've feel like you've got a good grasp of these models, you can just skim the content and come back if you need some clarification.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic sense, an agent-based model is one in which there is a universe of _things_ that _do stuff_. For example, when we were modeling the spread of zombies, we originally considered a model in which some fraction of the population were zombies or infected or in some other state. As time passes, the change in the fraction residing in each state varies depending on all the fractions. In an agent-based model, rather than consider fractions, we consider *individual agents*; that is, we would follow single zombies as they infect other agents. Agent-based models can thereby capture important spatial relationships that are obscured in other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs are among the most powerful and easy to use computational models; and, they are used across fields from chemistry, to biology, to finance, to social science, to ecology...and far beyond. Their ease of use stems from the fact that they are built on **rules**: if you can specify what the rules are in terms of code, it is not necessary to formulate your model directly in terms of equations. As we have just seen with compartmental models, tools like `odeint` make solving the equations trivial, so what is the advantage? The advantage is that sometimes the rule is not something easily expressible in terms of an equation; for example, \"go to the store if it is 5:00 and Julie hasn't called yet, but not if it is snowing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why ABMs? We can understand the original motivation by thinking about the term \"agent\". The idea was that there were entities, think of people, companies/markets or governments, that have ideas or opinions that can be influenced by other agents. If we can build into each agent all of its behaviors, we can then allow the agents to interact with each other to see what behaviors emerge. In fact, that is part of the thinking behind ABMs: design the smallest entity that matters to the model and allow new behavior to happen through the natural interactions among all of the agents. We design the notes and let the symphony happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs originated in the field of computational sociology. There were fairly strict definitions of what an agent was; it needed to have these four traits:\n",
    "1. autonomy - ability to act on its own\n",
    "2. social ability - can interact with other agents\n",
    "3. reactivity - reacts to both other agents and the environment\n",
    "4. proactivity - has some sort of belief system; or, has its own goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the term \"ABM\" has nearly lost its meaning because of its wide use (or, perhaps, *mis*use). Here, we will use a broader definition than the one just given. Let's think in terms of compartmental models. In compartmental models we would have $3-6$ different compartments; but, what if the \"thing\" in the compartment is much more complex? Let's consider a human, for example. A human might have:\n",
    "* an age\n",
    "* a height\n",
    "* a religious belief (or not)\n",
    "* a political preference\n",
    "* a very complex set of political beliefs (e.g., gun control, education, abortion, immigration, marriage, etc.)\n",
    "* many close friends\n",
    "* a hermit-like existence\n",
    "* estranged family members\n",
    "* only one kidney\n",
    "* a broken car\n",
    "* an IQ of 86\n",
    "* etc....\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this information into compartmental models becomes quite awkward. But, if we define each agent to be an **individual** person, we can sample from known distributions (e.g., age, height, health status) to assign statistical behavior to that person (e.g., using census data). There are two other definitions of ABMs can be confusing, but you should know about them. The first is a class of models based on things on a 2D grid, such as Conway's game of life:\n",
    "\n",
    "![CGoL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Gospers_glider_gun.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are better referred to as \"[cellular  automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)\", but today people sometimes use the term \"ABM\" to talk about them. And, second, when we include randomness in the model, people will then call the model an ABM, but compartmental models can have randomness and some ABMs are deterministic (not random); these are just stochastic models. In the end, it is only semantics and we will be very flexible with the definition from now on. But, you can see that *all of these modeling approaches start to blur together* and that the terminology can be messy in this area of computational modeling."

    "# Modeling a Forest Fire using an Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to make our first foray into ABMs by modeling a forest fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why model forest fires?\n",
    "\n",
    "While this isn't a huge problem in Michigan, the states in the western United States having been suffering a tremendous problem with huge and difficult-to-control forest fires.  This comes from a combination of extended drought conditions, dense woodlands, and forest management policies that suppress small fires and thus ensure that large quantities of dead, dry trees and brush are available to burn when a large fire inevitably starts (typically from lighting strikes, but occasionally from negligent campers).  In recent years, this has been exacerbated by climate change, which has both caused drought conditions to be more severe and allowed tree-killing diseases and insects to flourish, which produces more dead, easily-burned wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "These forest fires destroy ecosystems and peoples' homes and other property, and can result in the loss of human and animal life.  A key challenge in forest management is to attempt to contain these huge forest fires once they start, in order to protect human lives, settlements, and infrastructure.  To that end, it is critical to have models of how fire spreads in various conditions; see, for example, the [Open Wildland Fire Modeling group](http://www.openwfm.org/wiki/Open_Wildland_Fire_Modeling_E_community_Wiki).\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the type of model that we're going to create is an example of a \"percolation\" model, where one substance (in this case, fire) moves through another substance (in this case, forest).  This type of problem is interesting in a variety of fields, including geology (oil or water percolating through rock, sand, or soil), human behavior (crowd movement in amusement parks), and in physics (understanding how two materials mix together).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"tipping point\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model also demonstrates the concept of a \"critical threshold\" or a \"tipping point\".  This is a phenomenon that occurs when a small change in an input parameter results in a large change in outcome.  This is a phenomenon that shows up in both simple and complex models, and happens in such varied circumstances as forest fires, the spread of disease in populations, and the transfer of information within a population."

You can drag the slider back and forth to change the density.  After you do that, click the \"setup\" button and then click \"go\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**What do you observe?**  Try setting the \"density\" value to various numbers between 0 and 99, and see how the wildfire spreads.  What happens when the value is low versus when it is high?

    "\n",
    "In-class we'll be implementing the code for our forest fire model. In order to do this, we'll need code that's capable of plotting a 2D NumPy array, as well as code that will set up our initial forest and the start of our fire. This is what you'll work on in this pre-class assignment, so that we can work on coding up the rules of the model in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our forest will be represented by a two-dimensional, square array with sides that are N cells long. The cells in the array can have three values, 0 (empty), 1 (trees), and 2 (on fire).  At the beginning of the model, a user-specified fraction of the cells $\\mathrm{f_{trees\\_start}}$ (which is equivalent to the NetLogo `density` parameter) are randomly filled with trees, and the remaining cells are empty.  To start out, one edge of the board (say, the entire leftmost column) is set on fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we provide a function that takes an array as an input and generates a plot using the  `plt.plot()` function (as opposed to `plt.imshow()`).

Essentially, `meshgrid` takes one-dimensional arrays and creates new multi-dimensional arrays made up of the values from the one dimensional arrays. In the code below, for example, `meshgrid` takes the x and y values and creates two, new 2D arrays with the x and y values filling the arrays. You might need to experiment with meshgrid a bit on your own to understand how it works."

    "\n",
    "It turns out that the random number generators available on computers aren't truly random, they're actually \"pseudo-random.\" This is because the random number generators use mathematical algorithms to produce numbers that _seem_ random, but they are actually produced in a predictable and reproducible way based on the \"seed\" number that is given to the random number generator. This means that if we need to produce the same set of random numbers every time they are generated, we can define a specific seed number and use that to generate the numbers. If we want our random numbers to keep changing, we just let the computer pick the seed.\n",

    "## Coming back to setting up our \"forest\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step we want to figure out before we get to class is how to set up our forest so that we can model the spread of fire. Remember, we want the forest to be an NxN square where 0 is \"empty\", 1 is \"tree\", and 2 is \"fire\". The \"density\" of the forest or fraction of the forest initially covered in trees, $f_{tree\\_start}$, should be defined by the probability that a given cell starts off with a tree in it. Start off the board so that the leftmost column of the board is initialized to be \"on fire\"!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Write a function that creates the initial forest. The function should take in the size of the forest ($N$) and the probability that a given cell will contain a tree, $f_{tree\\_start}$, and then return the forest. Test out your function by plotting your forest array after you create it!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: The `np.zeros` function is a great way to initialize a 2D array full of zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Another hint*: To decide if a tree should exist in a cell, you can pick a random number between 0 and 1, and if the number is less than the value of $f_{tree\\_start}$, put a tree in the cell. If it's higher, don't put a tree there.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Final hint*: Once you've created an array of zeros, you just need to loop over all of the cells in the array and decide if a tree should go in the cell. When you're done doing that, go back and set the leftmost column to be on fire!\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, to loop through all of the cells in your 2D array and set the values equal to 1, you might do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Loop over the rows\n",
    "for r in range(board.shape[0]):\n",
    "    # Loop over the columns\n",
    "    for c in range(board.shape[1]):\n",
    "        board[r,c] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We commonly use `i` and `j` as our indices instead of `r` and `c`, which would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Loop over the rows\n",
    "for i in range(board.shape[0]):\n",
    "    # Loop over the columns\n",
    "    for j in range(board.shape[1]):\n",
    "        board[i,j] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
