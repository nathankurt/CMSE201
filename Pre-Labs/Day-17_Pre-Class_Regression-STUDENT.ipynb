    "## Part 1: What is Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems that arises in data science is that the data is invariably imperfect. We often say that the data has \"noise\" or \"fluctuations\". The problem is that we know that the fluctuations are not real: they are caused by errors in our measurements or any other factor that is not in our control. We do not want to take those fluctuations literally. In fact, in some cases the fluctuations might actually be real, but we don't want to focus our attention on those details because we simply want the trend. Regression solves this problem by providing a methodology to find a smoother function that is consistent with your data but doesn't attempt to match every detail, which you may not believe is real. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the most common forms of regression is called **linear regression**. Linear regression finds the best line that goes through noisy data. But, there are other forms of regression that we will be interested in. Here are some of the methods we will explore in this class:\n",
    "\n",
    "* linear regression: fitting a best-fit line through a data set\n",
    "* fitting polynomials: rather than assuming a line, which has the form $mx+b$, we might assume some other polynomial, such as $ax^2 + mx + b$\n",
    "* curve fitting: we might want to fit to some other curve, which you need to supply based on some insight into the data, of arbitrary form; for example, the exponential $a\\exp(-t)+ b$\n",
    "* autoregression: this uses the concept of a lag plot to generate future information based on past information\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, we will explore the first three, and we will do autoregression later in the week. For now, watch this video on regression and its use in data analysis."
